# ToDoList

This To Do List project is a web application that allows users to create and manage their daily tasks in a simple and efficient way. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with SQLite3 for the backend.

The frontend of the application is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The HTML markup and CSS styling ensure a responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices of different screen sizes.

In the backend, Node.js is used as the server-side technology to handle user requests and interact with the SQLite3 database. The SQLite3 database is used to store the user's task list, allowing them to retrieve and modify their tasks at any time.

The application uses popular libraries such as Express.js to handle routing.
